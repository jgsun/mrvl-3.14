Device tree bindings for Texas-Instruments drv2604 vibrator driver

Required properties:

 - compatible:		Should be "ti,drv2604-vibrator".
 - reg:		I2C client number (0x5a as defined in drv2604 datasheet).
 - vibrator-supply:	Regulator that supplies the vibrator driver.
 - average-voltage-mv:	The average voltage from motor spec. Needed to calculate
			the rated voltage.
 - average-overdrive-voltage-mv:
 			The average overdrive voltage. Needed to calculate the
			overdrive clamp voltage.

Optional properties:
 - trig_gpio:		Used to trigger the vibrator using GPIO instead of I2C writes.
			Note that if this property is not defined the driver
			will configure with I2C writes by default.
 - actuator-type:	Sets the actuator type (ERM or LRA). by default it is ERM.
 - bemf-gain:		Analog gain of back-EMF amplifier. By default sets to 0
			(x0.33 for ERM or x5 for LRA).
 - loop-response:	loop gain for the feedback control. By default sets to 1 (Medium).
 - brake-factor:	feedback gain ratio between braking gain and driving gain.
			By default sets to 2 (x3).
 - drive-time-usec:	ERM only, used to calculate overdrive clamp voltage.
			By default sets to 4800[usec].
 - current-dissipation-time-usec:
			ERM only, used to calculate overdrive clamp voltage.
			By default sets to 75[usec].
 - blanking-time-usec:	ERM only, used to calculate overdrive clamp voltage.
			By default sets to 75[usec].


Example:

	vibrator: vibrator@5a {
		compatible = "ti,drv2604-vibrator";
		reg = <0x5a>;
		vibrator-supply = <&ldo10>;
		rst_gpio = <&gpio 78 0>;
		actuator-type = <0>; //ERM
		average-voltage-mv = <2582>;
		average-overdrive-voltage-mv = <3600>;
	};
