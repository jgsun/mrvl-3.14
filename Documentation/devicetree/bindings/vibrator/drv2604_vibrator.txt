Device tree bindings for Texas-Instruments drv2604 vibrator driver

Required properties:

 - compatible:          Should be "ti,drv2604-vibrator".
 - reg:                 I2C client number (0x5a as defined in drv2604 datasheet).
 - vibrator-supply:     Regulator that supplies the vibrator driver.

Optional properties:
 - trig_gpio:		used to trigger the vibrator using GPIO instead of I2C writes.
			Note that if this property is not defined the driver
			will configure with I2C writes by default.

Example:

	vibrator: vibrator@5a {
		compatible = "ti,drv2604-vibrator";
		reg = <0x5a>;
		vibrator-supply = <&ldo10>;
		rst_gpio = <&gpio 78 0>;
	};
